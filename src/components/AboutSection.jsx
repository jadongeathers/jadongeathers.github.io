        <strong>Jadon Geathers</strong> is an Information Science PhD student at Cornell University, where he develops AI-powered conversational agents that enhance learning through authentic, personalized interactions. Grounded in learning sciences principles, his research focuses on creating educational technologies that provide immediate, adaptive feedback and bridge the gap between traditional classroom instruction and scalable practice opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        His work particularly targets areas where students need safe environments to build confidence through repeated, deliberate practice. Through iterative design with domain experts and comprehensive user studies, Jadon demonstrates how AI conversational agents can address fundamental challenges in education while maintaining the personalized support that learners need to thrive.
